// pk3s listed here must be present with correct checksums to allow pure to be enabled.
// If you modify a pk3 and change it's checksum here,
// all you accomplish is being able to run a server no one can join
// without your modified pk3s.

// If you want to use modified pk3s (and don't want the annoying pop up), uncomment the following line:
config noPakMismatchWarningDialog

// nodownload keyword tells server not to allow pk3 to be downloaded
